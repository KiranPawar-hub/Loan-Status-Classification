# Loan-Status-Classification
Loan Status Classification Here in this notebook we take a look at the data from a bank/financial organization of all their loans. We explore various features about the borrowers like credit score, mortgage, annual income, years of employment and try to train our classifiers to predict if the loan would be paid or not.
